-- DIFFERENCES BETWEEN GIT AND GITHUB --
   GIT : Basically it stores the history of the activities that takes place in files. It tracks down what
	   and when the changes are made in a particular codebase.It is used locally.
   GITHUB : Github is a service where people share their code to make changes and add different features.
 
-- GIT COMMANDS --
 git config -> It is used user related details
 git init -> This command creates a hidden file .git which tracks down the activities.
 git status -> This command checks and displays the status of the of the acvities that took place.
 git touch file name -> creates the file 	
 ls -> It list all the files in that directly
 rm -> deletes the file
 
-- HOW TO MAKE A PULL REQUEST --
So basically pull request is send when we want to make some changes with the forked repository.
Steps involved are : 
-> Firstly we fork the file from the admin's repository and then make a clone of that file in local drive.
-> Then we make the required changes or adding features in that particular code base.
-> Then we send a pull request to the admin. The admin reviews and suggests the needed changes and then
   it is merged it the master branch.
-> PULL REQUEST can be made directly from the github profile .
-> Another way to create a pull request is use the command git reuqest-pull
